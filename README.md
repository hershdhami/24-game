# 24-game Application

The other day I played a really fun game against one of my friends and am in the progress of making it into an app!

The point of this game is that you can use each number once, but your goal is to create the number 24 with any available operation listed in the Figure above. Normally this game is played with a deck of cards where the winner of each round would collect the 4 cards layed out in the middle.
